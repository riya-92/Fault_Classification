# Fault_Segmentation

## ✨Objective

Faults are typically recognized as lateral reflection discontinuities in a 3D seismic image.
Built a complex CNN Model to detect fault by `pixel-wise classification`.Retrain a simplified U-Net architecture to perform binary fault detection on Binary seismic Images.

## ✨Evaluation 

Following is an example, where the solid lines are **Faults** on a Seismic Image.
